# Global Editing Policy
WHEN: creating, modifying, deleting files OR running tools
DO:
- Ask me 2â€“3 clarifying questions before proposing changes.
- Show a plan + list the exact files you intend to touch.
- Generate a unified diff preview only; do not apply until I say "apply".
- If changes span >3 files, stop and ask to split into smaller PR-sized tasks.
NEVER:
- Auto-refactor or rename files/modules without explicit approval.
