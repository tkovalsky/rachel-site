# 🏘️ **Content Management System Guide**

## 📋 **Content-Driven Process (No Code Editing Required!)**

### **🎯 The Right Way: Create Content in Folders**

Instead of editing code files, you create content in markdown files in the `src/content/` folder structure. The system automatically processes these files and makes them available on your website.

---

## 📁 **Content Folder Structure**

```
src/content/
├── articles/           # Success stories, guides, market updates
├── areas/             # City/neighborhood information
├── developments/       # Community/development details
└── neighborhoods/     # Specific neighborhood guides
```
