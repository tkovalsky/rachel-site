When the Grinkevichs began their search for a vacation home, they had one clear vision: a place where their adult children and grandchildren could create lasting memories together. As successful business owners from New Jersey, they were ready to invest in a property that would serve as both a personal retreat and a gathering place for their growing family.

## The Challenge
