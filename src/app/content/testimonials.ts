    q: `We feel incredibly lucky to have worked with Rachel Kovalsky to find our home. From the very beginning, she was relentless in her efforts, always showing up with energy, insight, and a down-to-earth approach that immediately put us at ease. She took the time to truly understand not just our list of wants and needs, but the deeper, more emotional aspects of what “home” meant to us. Even when we weren’t sure ourselves what we were looking for, she patiently guided us, never showing a hint of frustration. What stood out the most was how she balanced professionalism with warmth. She respected our budget and never pressured us, even when the search felt long and uncertain. Instead, she stayed focused, optimistic, and supportive, reminding us that the right place would come, and when it did, we would just know. And she was right! Thanks to her persistence and care, we found a home that’s more than we ever imagined. Rachel wasn’t just our real estate broker, she became our partner, our advocate, and in many ways, our compass. We’re forever grateful.`,
