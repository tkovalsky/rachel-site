# Legacy by the Sea: How the Goldmans Turned a Condo Into a Family Treasure

For Barry and Linda Goldman, the dream of escaping another New Jersey winter wasn’t new. Every February brought the same conversation over coffee: *“Should we start looking?”* But life, like always, got in the way. Their business kept them busy. The grandkids needed attention. And frankly, buying a second home from a thousand miles away felt overwhelming.

Still, the itch wouldn’t go away. Their kids were grown, the grandkids were getting older, and their beloved two-story colonial — full of memories — was starting to feel more like a burden than a haven. What they craved was freedom, sun, and simplicity. What they wanted — but didn’t know yet — was Boca Raton.

## A Condo That Changed Everything

It started with a conversation. Barry’s old college friend had just closed on a place in South Florida and raved about his real estate agent, Rachel Kovalsky. “Call Rachel,” he said. “She’ll make it painless.”

He wasn’t wrong.

Rachel didn’t just run comps or email listings. She *listened*. She understood that Barry and Linda weren’t just shopping for square footage — they were looking for something bigger: a home base for the next chapter of life, one that brought their family closer together and gave them room to breathe.

When Rachel suggested a light-filled condo in Boca Raton’s Mizner Park district, it all clicked. The location was perfect — walkable to restaurants, art galleries, and coffee shops, but still tucked into a quiet, upscale community. Just 20 minutes from **Palm Beach International Airport**, it meant their grandkids could hop on a **2.5-hour nonstop flight from Newark** and be poolside by afternoon.

The unit itself? Turnkey. Two bedrooms, concierge service, covered parking, and a sun-soaked balcony overlooking swaying palms. No yard work. No headaches. Just peace.

## More Than a Vacation Home

Barry and Linda weren’t just thinking about now — they were thinking about legacy. They saw how this property could be the backdrop for family memories and a long-term investment. Rachel walked them through how the Florida market was trending, how demand was shifting toward low-maintenance luxury, and even helped them structure the purchase with an eye toward **relocating part of Barry’s consulting business** to take advantage of Florida’s tax-friendly climate.

“This wasn’t just about real estate,” Barry later said. “It was a lifestyle play — and Rachel saw that before we did.”

## A Seamless Experience from Start to Finish

Buying a property out of state is never easy. But with Rachel, it felt effortless. She coordinated everything: virtual tours, inspections, a local attorney, even an accountant who specialized in snowbird transitions. By the time Barry and Linda flew down for their final walkthrough, the fridge was stocked, and the beds were made.

The family’s now using the condo year-round. Barry takes Zoom calls from the balcony. Linda’s joined a watercolor class at the museum. The grandkids spent spring break in the pool. Their son and daughter-in-law are even eyeing a long weekend this fall.

## Your Legacy Could Start Here

If you’ve been thinking about a move — not just to escape the cold, but to invest in your family’s future — now might be the time to act.

Whether you want a warm-weather escape, a multigenerational gathering place, or a smart financial play with business potential, **Rachel will meet you where you are and guide you where you want to go.**

The Goldmans didn’t just buy a condo. They bought a lifestyle. A legacy. And it all started with one conversation.
