SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@yourdomain.com
SMTP_PASS=your-password
MAIL_TO=rachel@compass.com

```

## ðŸ“§ How It Works

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Set up SMTP credentials** in your environment variables
2. **Test the forms** to ensure emails are being sent
3. **Optional: Add database** for lead tracking (see below)

If you want to track leads in a database, you can add:

```env

```

- See who signed up for newsletter
- Follow up on contact inquiries
